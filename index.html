      Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu">School of
        Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by 
        <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/">Nina Balcan</a> and
        <a href="https://zstevenwu.com/">Steven Wu</a>, and supported by the 
      <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>. 
      
      I am currently a research intern with the 
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/economics-and-computation/">Economics and Computation</a> 
      group at 
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/">Microsoft Research - New England</a>, 
      hosted by 
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/slivkins/">Alex Slivkins</a>.
      Before coming to CMU, I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from
       <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State University</a>
      with Bachelor of Science degrees in
      <a href="http://www.eecs.psu.edu">Computer Science</a> and
      <a href="https://science.psu.edu/physics">Physics</a>.
    </p>

     <p>
       I am interested in topics at the intersection of machine learning, algorithmic game theory, and econometrics. 
       Specifically, my goal is to develop principled algorithms for modern data-driven decision-making. 
       To this end, my research has been focused on three (often interleaved) areas:
       <ol>
         <li><b>Learning and decision-making using panel data:</b> In settings such as e-commerce, content recommendation systems, and clinical trials, 
          one often observes repeated, noisy, measurements from a collection of individuals over a period of time. Such settings are ubiquitous in today's
          digital world, and are often referred to as panel data settings.
          I am interested in leveraging the temporal structure and similarity between individuals typically present in panel data 
          to design better algorithms for decision-making in real-world settings. The leap from counterfactual inference to decision making
            results in additional challenges which must be taken into consideration. To this end, my research has focused on learning from panel data which has been 
           adaptively collected and learning & decision-making in the presence of strategic individuals.<br>
           <em>Relevant Publications:</em>
         <ul>
            <li>Adaptive Principal Component Regression with Applications to Causal Inference with Panel Data (working paper, manuscript available upon request)</li>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14236.pdf">Strategyproof Decision-Making in Panel Data Settings and Beyond</a> (preprint)</li>
          </ul>
         </li>
        <li><b>Algorithmic decision-making under incentives:</b> When algorithmic assessment tools are used in high-stakes domains such as 
          lending, education, or employment, decision-subjects have an incentive to modify their input to the algorithm in 
          order to receive a more desirable outcome. As a result, machine learning systems deployed in these settings need to take 
          such strategic interactions into consideration in order to make reliable predictions (and decisions). 
          To this end, I have investigated the effects of partial feedback, incomplete information, causal learning, and repeated interactions in the 
          domain of algorithmic decision-making under incentives.<br>

        </ul>
         </li>
        <li><b>Learning in non-stationary environments:</b> While classical machine learning focuses on learning a single model for a single task using data from a stationary distribution, 
          the real world is often non-stationary and requires reasoning about many different-but-related tasks, often with just a small amount of data from each. 
          For example, in online advertising auctions, the advertiserâ€™s value for different keywords adapts based on current marketing trends. 
          In online marketplaces, the price consumers are willing to pay for different products varies based on the current economic outlook. 
          My research in this area has been focused on developing meta-learning algorithms for decision-making with provable performance guarantees, 
          which are capable of operating under partial feedback and in the presence of other strategic agents.<br>
