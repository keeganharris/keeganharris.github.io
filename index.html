      I am a <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu">Machine Learning</a> Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>,  
      where I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/">Nina Balcan</a> and <a href="https://zstevenwu.com/">Steven Wu</a>, and my research focuses on machine learning for decision making. I am fortunate to be supported by the 
      <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/">NDSEG Fellowship</a> and selected as a <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/rising-stars-in-data-science/">Rising Star in Data Science</a>. 
      I am also the head editor of the 
      <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/">ML@CMU blog</a>. 
      Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgMwwSL2GhXEEJpx-86mbjOTJdrxE_BUywloKTle6RYsVK9g/viewform">

     <p>
      In Summer 2023 and Summer 2024 I was a research intern at 
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a> with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/slivkins/">Alex Slivkins</a>.  
      I obtained a Master of Science degree in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon in 2022. 
      Before coming to CMU, I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from
       <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State University</a>
      with Bachelor of Science degrees in
      <a href="http://www.eecs.psu.edu">Computer Science</a> and
      <a href="https://science.psu.edu/physics">Physics</a>, where I also did research at the <a href="https://www.arl.psu.edu/">Applied Research Laboratory</a>.
